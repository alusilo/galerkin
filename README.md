In this source you can find a **Discontinuous Galerkin** code (1D and 2D versions) to propagate waves in a isotropic medium. **Discontinuous Galerkin Method** is a numerical method to solve a wide range of **Partial Differential Equations**. The development of this code is based on a **MATLAB** code version developed by **Jan S. Hesthaven** and **Tim Warburton** in their book _Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Method_. This code was developed using python libraries for academic purpose.
To run and test the code execute the `run.py` file using a terminal.
```
$ chmod +x run.py
$ ./run.py
```

This code was tested using **python** `2.7` and `3.5`.
